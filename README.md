# Optimization-of-PID


Aim: to improve the stability and performance of the PID controller for interval Plants

Topics: System Optimization Method

Software: Matlab

Implementation: 
  * Objective function is found by pole placement method and the constraints are framed by hurwitz Criteria
  * Used Quadratic Programming (Lagrange Multipliers) and Linear programming (2 Phase Simplex). 
  * Optimum Ki (1.875), Kp (2.059) values are obtained thus improving the stability and performance of the PID controller and verified using MATLAB
